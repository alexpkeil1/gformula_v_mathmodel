### gformula_v_mathmodel ###
Implementation of the Bayesian g-formula

Purpose: give heuristic to show the relations between mathematical modeling and the Bayesian g-formula
Descriptions: gives "slider" bars to control the priors of the Bayesian g-formula. At the extremes
	are mathematical modeling (point mass priors) or the frequentist g-formula (highly diffuse priors).
 

Running: If you have R installed, install the "shiny" package and the "Rstan" package 
	(install instructions here https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)
	
Once R and the two packages are installed, open R and run:
	library("shiny")
	runGitHub("gformula_v_mathmodel", "alexpkeil1")
